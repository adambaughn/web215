<h2 id="assignment_title">Node Beginner Page</h2>
<div id="node_beginner_text">
<p>I decided to modify my code to use express to render pieces of my page from views. 
   The head, header, main, and footer content is stored in a folder named partials within another folder named view. 
   The index page is stored in a folder named pages that is also inside the view folder. 
   The scripts, styles, and images folders are stored inside another folder called public. 
   All of the pages containing html were saved as ejs files for express to render as html. 
   My code combined my ejs files to create an exact copy of my ToC page that is fully functional. 
   The first image of code is the server.js code. 
   Below it you will see an image of the folder structure and an image of the HTML inside of the index.ejs file.
