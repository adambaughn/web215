<h2 id="assignment_title">Node Beginner Page</h2>
<div id="node_beginner_text">
<p>I decided to modify my code to use express to render pieces of my page from views. 
   The head, header, main, and footer content is stored in a folder named partials within another folder named view. 
   The index page is stored in a folder named pages that is also inside the view folder. 
   All of the pages were saved as ejs files for express to render as html.
