  <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born and raised in the Charlotte area. I enjoy reading, fixing things, and learning how stuff works.</li></br>
  <li><b>Professional Background:</b> I'm an equities trader and I love it. I enjoy reading charts, numbers, and business news articles.</li></br>
  <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I have a degree in Database Analysis/Programming. This semester I'll finish my degrees in Web Technologies and Database Dev/Business Intel. After this semester I will only need 1 more class for my degree in IT Business Analysis and I will work on finishing my degree in Full Stack Programming.</li></br>
  <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows 10 Pro running a Core i7-3770, 2 GeForceGTX 1080s, 16GB overclocked RAM, many SSDs and 6 monitors. It's a dinosaur but it still runs like a champ.</li></br> 
  <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
   <ul class="sublist">
     <li><b>ACA122: College Transfer Success</b> - I'm taking this course because it became a requirement for Database Dev/Business Intel. I'm not happy about it.</li>
     <li><b>CSC124: Intro to Data Science Programming</b> - This is a requirement for IT Business Analysis and the course information makes it sound like we'll have a lot of fun learning the material in this class.</li>
     <li><b>CTS230: Advanced Spreadsheet</b> - This is a requirement for IT Business Analysis and a Prerequisite for CTS225: Spreadsheet Analysis. I'm not excited about this class because it's just an excel class.</li>
     <li><b>DBA125: Database Reporting</b> - This is a requirement for IT Business Analysis and Database Dev/Business Intel. I'll be able to pick up some useful information from this course.</li>
     <li><a href="https://adambaughn.github.io/web215_adambaughn/"><b>WEB215: Advanced Markup and Scripting</b></a> - I'm taking this class because D.I. von Briesen is the instructor.</li></br>
   </ul>
  </li> 
 <li><b>Something to Remember Me by:</b> I'd prefer to sit in front of a computer to sitting on a beach.</li></br>
 <li><b>I'd Also Like to Share:</b> I've enjoyed all of D.I.'s classes so I'm excited about taking WEB215 this semester.</li></br>
</ul>
